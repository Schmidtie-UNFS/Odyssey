##planet
planet.odyssey-veritaxia.name = Veritaxia
planet.odyssey-veritaxia.description = Home planet of the Veritax people. It appears to be held together by the original planet's gravity.

## effect
block.odyssey-veritax-base-lion.name = LiON Base
block.odyssey-veritax-base-lion.description = The first of many expeditionary pods. Outputs basic power for missions.
block.odyssey-q-node-t1.name = Quantum Node
block.odyssey-q-node-t1.description = One of the Veritax feats of technology. Uses quantum tunneling to store items in a separate dimensional space. According to Veritax standards, this is mediocre storage.
block.odyssey-q-node-t2.name = Quantum Box
block.odyssey-q-node-t2.description = Second Tier quantum storage. Capable of doubling the space of the node. Incredibly weak to attacks.
block.odyssey-q-node-t3.name = Quantum Cube
block.odyssey-q-node-t3.description = Third Tier quantum storage. Holds more than the Quantum Box, but still suffers from low health.
block.odyssey-q-node-t4.name = Quantum Rift
block.odyssey-q-node-t4.description = Fourth Tier quantum storage. Massive capacity, and yet more research still remains.
block.odyssey-quantum-shield.name = Quantum Shield
block.odyssey-quantum-shield.description = Lost Veritaxian technology for shielding. The apparatus is fragile, but the shield it produces is nothing to scoff at.

## block
block.odyssey-lithium-press.name = Lithium Press
block.odyssey-lithium-press.description = Ancient Veritax technology. Presses titanium and silicon to produce Lithium.
block.odyssey-pressurizer.name = Pressurizer
block.odyssey-pressurizer.description = Compresses Lithium with Graphite and Sand to generate Ferrium.
block.odyssey-quantum-polarizer.name = Quantum Polarizer
block.odyssey-quantum-polarizer.description = Used in the production of Qubidium. It's unclear how the technology works, but it produces the necessary quantum materials for expansion.
block.odyssey-entangler.name = Entangler
block.odyssey-entangler.description = Designed for the process of quantum entanglement. Through careful research, a new material has been produced.

## item
item.odyssey-lithium.name = Lithium
item.odyssey-lithium.description = An ore that the Veritax technarchy uncovered early on. Used for batteries and technological advancements.
item.odyssey-ferrium.name = Ferrium
item.odyssey-ferrium.description = Basic, ferrous-like compound produced in the Pressurizer. Used to develop early Veritax technology.
item.odyssey-radium.name = Radium
item.odyssey-radium.description = A glowing ore. Used to produce most quantum materials.
item.odyssey-qubidium.name = Qubidium
item.odyssey-qubidium.description = The results of blasting materials with ionizing radiation. This material is capable of greatly enhancing quantum capacity.
item.odyssey-quantanium.name = Quantanium
item.odyssey-quantanium.description = The first of quantum materials used by the Veritax people. It eminates an eerie glow.
